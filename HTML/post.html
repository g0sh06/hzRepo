        <p>The IT field is always spreading with high speed.<br>
            There is a big list of jobs, which are wating to be fulfil with quality workers.<br>
            After the big offering of working place comes the work development(in meaning salary
            and better promoting chances). After all i believe that most of the people are working a job
            not only for personal fulfilment, but also for the monthly wage. Also programming is one of my passions.
            When I am studying i think that i can reveal my full potential.<br>
            After my graduation I will be focused on finding a job related to my university education. But for now this
            several years in the future and can not predict how everything is going to go.
