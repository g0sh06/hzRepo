        <p> Profession<br><br>
            The companies, which i chose are Oracle Corporation, IBM and Rockstar Games. Let's start with the first one. 
            Oracle Corporation is a multinational company with headquarter in Texas. They offer a big variaty of products,
            which they produce. The are selling database software, cloud engineering systems, enterprice software, 
            customer relationship software and more. A person can work as a Software Engineer, AI engineer, Cloud Architect, but you more
            bussines oriented are also jobs like Project Manager, Bussines System Analysist and etc. Some of the technologies they use(specifically
            for IT jobs) are SAP, SQL, Java, PHP etc. , Oracle ADF. Oracles's working culture is shaped by diversity, equity, inclusion, communication,
            customer influence and etc. For me it will be pleasure to be part of the Oracle's, because this one of the biggest software companies and 
            from articles I can find out that the working environment is friendly. <br>
            The second company is IBM. I think everybody has ever head about IBM. They operate in 175 countries and their are of work is in big variaty of IT field:
            hardware(laptops), software, hosting and consulting services, nanotechnology and quantum computing. They are always developing different fields of work,
            which means that they are always hiring. Their job offers vary widely: from Bussines Analyst, Associate Consultant, Reporting Analyst to Data Scientist, 
            AI engineer, Front End Dev. , Software Engineer. Some of the technologies IBM's employees use are DevOps, Quantum Computing. Databases, AI and machine learning.
            According to a survey a lot of people like to work in IBM, because of the people and working enviroment. Also because of the opportunities, good career,
            diversity, flexibilty. Personally I would really want to work for IBM, becase as we can see their work is in IT fields, which are still relatively new and still
            developing.<br>
            And the last company is Rockastar Games. I personally think that this company is one of the most legendary copmany in the field of game development. Their work 
            is tightly connected with developing and publishing game. Unfortunately Rockstar Games does not have another activity in another IT area. Some their most famous 
            products are GTA game serie, Red Dead Redemption game serie and Midnight Club.The technology Rockstar Games employees use are Unity(software for game dev.),
            C++(the fastest language ever created), Microsoft Azure and etc.
